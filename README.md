<section class="project-context">
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Energy stakeholders and consumers would like to know the
        current state of energy consumption and what could be points of growth for energy efficiency.
        The key questiosn to ask:
        Are older homes better or worse for energy conservation?
        Does income impact how much spending a household uses or their consumption?
        What is the housing type with the smallest amount of consumption?
        The federal government has passed legislation to help electrify the country. What is the most used energy source in the South?

    <h2>Data Structure</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Data was cleaned for blank values, inconsistent values, and correct formatting in Excel</li>
        <li>This data is provided by the United States Energy Information Administration. This survey is done in 4 year increments. This data visualization seeks to understand the inquiries of:
  <i>Are older homes better or worse for energy conservation?
  Does income impact how much spending a household uses or their consumption?
  What is the housing type with the smallest amount of consumption?
  The federal government has passed legislation to help electrify the country. What is the most used energy source in the South?</i>></li>
    </ul>

<section class="project-results">
    <h2>Results & Business Impact</h2>
    <p>
        The data shows that spending fluctuated significantly between older homes of 1950 to more current homes. Spending in houses constructed between 2016-2020 marked the lowest in over half a century.
The highest earners in the South consume almost 6 times the energy of the lowest earners.
Apartments make up the smallest percentage of spending and consumption. 
Electrification is well underway in the South with consumption almost parallel to gas energy.

<section class="project-results">
    <h2>Results & Business Impact</h2>
    <p>
        A'ja Wilson leads in stats both offensively and defensively. She is not a roleplayer
        (as indicated by her double digit statistics across the board). On nights where her points
        are not in the twenty point range, her assists count is high. This analysis focused heavily
        on Blocks due to A'ja being awarded co-defensive player of the year. She missed few games
        due to injury. When looking at the stat sheet and the games, the Seattle Storm, Indiana Fever,
        and Minnesota Lynx provide the biggest threat to her either offensivley or defensively. However, 
        she has more games where her blocks were above her average than zero.
